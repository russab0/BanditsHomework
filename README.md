# Bandits Homework

**Author**: Ruslan Sabirov

**Group**: BS17-DS-02

**Course**: [S21] Statistical techniques for Data Science

## Task
Implementation and simulation
- One of the Basic methods (eps-greedy, UCB1)
- Implement TS for Bernoulli reward
- Try to implement both (UCB and TS) in case of Gaussian rewards
- \* TS method for Correlated Travel Times (Example 4.2 on page 22 of the Tutorial) \[assume that there is a correlation between travel costs]

The expected result is a short (1-2 pages) report with you findings + links to experiments
